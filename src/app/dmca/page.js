            If any of the above details are not completely or inappropriately
            filled and sent to Sportzwiki, in minor cases the request may not be
            considered and in certain cases may ultimately result in a suit
            being filed by the company against the individual or company who is
            trying to wrongfully frame Sportzwiki in a baseless case.

            complaint/ notice/ request is received by us it will revert to the
            aggrieved party in writing (on the email id used for sending the
            complaint/ notice/ request) acknowledging the same with a requested
            duration during which the concerned issue will be rightfully
            addressed.
